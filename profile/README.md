- **Two-factor authentication** to safeguard user accounts.
- **Regular security audits** to identify and address vulnerabilities.
- **Data minimization** practices to collect only what’s necessary.

Your privacy and safety are non-negotiable, and we’re committed to maintaining a platform where you can communicate with confidence.

## Freedom of Speech
Voxa Communications is built on the principle that open discourse is essential for progress. We strive to create a platform where voices can be heard, and ideas can be shared freely, while balancing the need for responsible moderation to prevent harm. Our policies are transparent, and our moderation processes are designed to be fair and accountable.

## Our Funding Model
We operate as a not-for-profit organization, driven by our mission to create a free and open communication platform rather than financial gain. We are funded through:
 - Sponsorships: Partnerships with like-minded organizations that share our vision for secure and open communication.
